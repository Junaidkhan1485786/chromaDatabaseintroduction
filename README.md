## Introduction

ChromaDB provides efficient storage and querying capabilities for high-dimensional vectors. It supports embedding-based searches, making it suitable for tasks like similarity search, recommendation systems, and more.

## Installation

To use ChromaDB, you need to install the `chromadb` Python package. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install chromadb
Basic Usage
1. Initializing ChromaDB
First, import the necessary libraries and initialize the ChromaDB client:

python
Copy code
import chromadb

# Initialize ChromaDB client
client = chromadb.Client()
2. Creating a Collection
A collection is where you store vectors and associated metadata. Create a collection as follows:

python
Copy code
collection = client.create_collection(name="my_collection")
3. Adding Data
Add vectors, metadata, documents, and IDs to your collection:

python
Copy code
collection.add(
    embeddings=[
        [1.1, 2.3, 3.2],
        [4.5, 6.9, 4.4],
        [1.1, 2.3, 3.2],
        [4.5, 6.9, 4.4],
    ],
    metadatas=[
        {"uri": "img1.png", "style": "style1"},
        {"uri": "img2.png", "style": "style2"},
        {"uri": "img3.png", "style": "style1"},
        {"uri": "img4.png", "style": "style1"},
    ],
    documents=["doc1", "doc2", "doc3", "doc4"],
    ids=["id1", "id2", "id3", "id4"],
)
4. Querying the Collection
To find similar vectors, perform a query:

python
Copy code
query_result = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[[1.1, 2.3, 3.2], [5.1, 4.3, 2.2]],
    n_results=2,
)
5. Printing Results
Display the results in a readable vertical format:

python
Copy code
def print_query_results(results):
    ids = results['ids']
    distances = results['distances']
    metadatas = results['metadatas']
    documents = results['documents']

    for i in range(len(ids)):
        print(f"Query {i + 1}:")
        print(f"  IDs:")
        for id in ids[i]:
            print(f"    {id}")
        print(f"  Distances:")
        for distance in distances[i]:
            print(f"    {distance:.2f}")
        print(f"  Metadata:")
        for meta in metadatas[i]:
            print(f"    Style: {meta['style']}, URI: {meta['uri']}")
        print(f"  Documents:")
        for doc in documents[i]:
            print(f"    {doc}")
        print()

print_query_results(query_result)
Advanced Usage
1. Updating Data
To update existing data in the collection:

python
Copy code
collection.update(
    ids=["id1", "id2"],
    embeddings=[[2.2, 3.3, 4.4], [5.6, 7.8, 9.0]],
    metadatas=[{"uri": "img10.png", "style": "style3"}, {"uri": "img20.png", "style": "style4"}]
)
2. Deleting Data
To delete data from the collection:

python
Copy code
collection.delete(ids=["id1", "id2"])
3. Advanced Queries
Perform more complex queries with custom filters or multiple embeddings:

python
Copy code
query_result = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[[1.1, 2.3, 3.2], [5.1, 4.3, 2.2]],
    n_results=5,  # Retrieve top 5 results
    filter={"style": "style1"}  # Filter results based on metadata
)
Examples
Example 1: Similarity Search
Find the most similar vectors to a given query:

python
Copy code
query_result = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[[2.2, 3.3, 4.4]],
    n_results=3
)
print_query_results(query_result)
Example 2: Recommendation System
Use embeddings to recommend items based on user preferences:

python
Copy code
user_preference = [3.0, 2.5, 4.0]
recommendations = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[user_preference],
    n_results=5
)
print_query_results(recommendations)
FAQ
Q: How do I handle large datasets?
A: ChromaDB is designed to scale with large datasets. Consider using pagination for queries and indexing for faster search.

Q: Can I use ChromaDB with other databases?
A: Yes, ChromaDB can be integrated with other databases to enhance data management capabilities.
